# Subscription Fixes Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated Notification Methods

- **Problem**: `Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription()` was deprecated in Expo SDK 53+
- **Solution**: Updated to use `subscription.remove()` method
- **Files**: `hooks/useNotificationSetup.ts`, `hooks/useNotifications.ts`

### 2. Real-time Subscription Errors

- **Problem**: Multiple CHANNEL_ERROR and CLOSED states causing excessive retries
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced retry attempts from 2 to 1
  - Increased retry delay from 5s to 10s
  - Added component mount state checks to prevent retries after unmount
  - Increased subscription timeout from 10s to 15s

### 3. Profile Subscription Issues

- **Problem**: Multiple profile subscriptions being created and causing CLOSED states
- **Solution**:
  - Added duplicate subscription prevention
  - Added null user ID checks
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Better cleanup of existing subscriptions

### 4. Memory Leaks

- **Problem**: Subscriptions not being properly cleaned up
- **Solution**:
  - Created utility functions for safe cleanup
  - Added proper cleanup in useEffect return functions
  - Added mounted state tracking to prevent operations after unmount

## Configuration

### Subscription Constants (`constants/subscriptionConfig.ts`)

```typescript
export const SUBSCRIPTION_CONFIG = {
  SUBSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT: 15000, // 15 seconds
  RETRY_DELAY: 10000, // 10 seconds
  MAX_RETRIES: 1, // Only retry once
  POLLING_INTERVAL: 30000, // 30 seconds fallback
  PROFILE_SUBSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT: 10000, // 10 seconds
};
```

### Utility Functions (`utils/subscriptionUtils.ts`)

- `cleanupSubscription()` - Safely cleanup Supabase subscriptions
- `cleanupInterval()` - Safely cleanup setInterval
- `cleanupTimeout()` - Safely cleanup setTimeout

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Retry Policy**: Only retry failed subscriptions once to avoid excessive attempts
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Always cleanup subscriptions, intervals, and timeouts
3. **Mount State Tracking**: Prevent operations after component unmount
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful fallback to polling when real-time fails
5. **Configuration Centralization**: All timeout and retry values in one place

## Expected Results

- Reduced console warnings and errors
- More stable real-time subscriptions
- Better performance with fewer retry attempts
- Cleaner memory management
- More predictable subscription behavior
