# Business User Restrictions Removed

## Issue

The app had unnecessary restrictions that only allowed business accounts to create posts and manage companies, which was limiting the user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Permissions System

**File**: `hooks/auth/usePermissions.ts`

- **Before**: Only business users could create posts and manage companies
- **After**: All authenticated users can create posts and manage companies
- **Kept**: Analytics still restricted to business users only

```typescript
// Before
case 'create:post':
case 'manage:company':
case 'view:analytics':
    return isBusinessUser;

// After
case 'create:post':
case 'manage:company':
    return isAuthenticated; // Allow all authenticated users

case 'view:analytics':
    return isBusinessUser; // Keep analytics for business users only
```

### 2. Removed Company Creation Restrictions

**Files**:

- `app/profile/companies.tsx`
- `app/profile/CompanyManagement.tsx`
- `components/profile/CompaniesList.tsx`

- Removed business user checks before allowing company creation
- Removed "Only business accounts can create companies" messages
- All authenticated users can now create and manage companies

### 3. Removed Applications Page Restrictions

**File**: `app/(tabs)/applications.tsx`

- Removed business user restriction that prevented non-business users from viewing applications
- All authenticated users can now view their applications and posts

### 4. Removed Post Creation Restrictions

**Files**:

- `components/home/Header.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

- Removed business user check for showing the "Add Post" button
- All authenticated users can now create posts from the home screen

## Summary

**What was removed:**

- Business user restrictions on creating posts
- Business user restrictions on creating/managing companies
- Business user restrictions on viewing applications
- "Only business accounts can..." messages throughout the app

**What was kept:**

- Analytics features still restricted to business users
- User type distinction (user vs business) for potential future features
- All other functionality remains the same

**Result:**
All authenticated users can now:

- ✅ Create posts (jobs and news)
- ✅ Create and manage companies
- ✅ View their applications and posts
- ✅ Access all core features of the app

The app is now more inclusive and allows all users to participate fully in the platform!
