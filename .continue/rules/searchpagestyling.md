When styling search components:
1. Use Tailwind CSS classes instead of StyleSheet objects
2. Follow a consistent color scheme with blues for primary actions and grays for backgrounds
3. Use proper spacing: p-4 for main containers, mt-3 for spacing between sections
4. Use dividers with divide-y divide-gray-200 for list items
5. Use responsive design patterns with flex and overflow handling
